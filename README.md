# Lispy-rs


This is an implmentation of the book www.buildyourownlisp.com . I wanted to see
how experience of writing a simple language in rust would be like. Right now
the langauage only has variables, and runs only in a REPL. I plan on seeing how
far I can take this project by including things like a simple type system and
a garbage collector.
